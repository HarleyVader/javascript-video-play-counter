challange is developing client server api calls using nodejs [express fs path body-pharser level https] on a VPS with nginx & apache2 handling hosting the reverse proxy & control panel infrastructure

realization there is no need to use https with express as nginx handles the SSL certificate, solution could be to just add a listener to nginx for the express port


internally nginx uses http
### confuz

custom public configuration files of my NSFW VPS i never spam i organically trap you in brandynettes web .........
if you hecker me up please leave comments for ecucational purposes ^^

unconfuz: let the control panel handle the cert folder permissions
dont expose cert path on node app

posiblity? just get nginx to listen for all node apps on the same port
node container folder isolating the prossess?
