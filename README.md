challange is developing client server api calls using nodejs [express fs path body-pharser level https] on a VPS with nginx & apache2 handling hosting the reverse proxy & control panel infrastructure

### client>api>server>db>update>api>client>update-html



the goal is to use existing system pathways to open port 3000 for hosting a javacript avideo play counter 
express listens on port 3000 butt due to system configuration has no accessto the https cetificates 
cant seem to get the correct server port listener to catch api calls & respond to https

internally nginx uses http
externally apache2 uses https getting the certs from nginx
